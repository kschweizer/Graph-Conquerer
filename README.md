# Graph-Conquerer

Input graph-matrix examples in the `/inputs` directory

example input: 

    3 
    Kanto Johto Hoenn
    Johto
    1 6 x
    6 2 0.5
    x 0.5 3
    
In this instance, Johto is the starting node, which has a conquer value of 2 (the value at x=2,y=2). Johto has an edge between itself and Kanto of length 6 (value at x=2,y=1 and x=1,y=2 NOTE: always symmetrical)
